# Food-Recoginition-and-Nutrition-Estimation-Using-Deep-Learning
Designed and implemented a deep learning-based model to analyze food images, detect items, and estimate nutritional content based on BMI. Technologies Used: Utilized TensorFlow and Keras for deep learning model development; employed streamlit for backend integration and Streamlit for user interface design.

IMPLEMENTATION OF PROJECT 

1.Uploading Food Image dataset.csv file
2.By using the MobileNetv2 for Identification of the food.
3.Classifying the food images to categories using the CNN model.
4.Preparing the nutrition chart through automatic web scrapping using streamlit for web interface.
5.Calculating the user's BMI by taking the input from the user.
6.Food recommendation for the user as per his/her BMI.
